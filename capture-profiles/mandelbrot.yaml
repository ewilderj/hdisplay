readiness_detection:
  strategy: 'animation'          # detect progressive drawing on first render
  animation_threshold: 0.02      # subtle but sustained pixel changes
  stable_frames: 3
  timeout: 25000                 # initial render can take up to ~15s

screenshot:
  after_detection: 15000          # give a moment after first pixels appear

video:
  duration: 20000                 # capture crossfade + a bit of next view
  trim_ms: 29000                 # effectively start around 22s from apply

sample_data:
  duration: 4000                 # dwell so first crossfade ≈ 15s + 7s ≈ 22s
  colorScheme: 'ocean'           # readable default for docs/captures
